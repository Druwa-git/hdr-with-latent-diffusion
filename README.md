# HDR Imaging with Latent Diffusion Models

**Notes**
```diff
- We failed to reproduce HDR Imaging with Latent Diffusion.
```
- So we change the baseline method to [Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09672).
- Please don't use this code for HDR Imaging.

All of our code builds heavily on [latent-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion).
